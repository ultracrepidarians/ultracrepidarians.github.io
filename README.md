# TODO

- Implement widgets: search bar, dark theme, socials, AOB.
- Make widgets into \_includes so it can be used on post pages (and all others?)
- Look into minima for markdown support. Implement for posts.

# Ideas

- Replace About and Contact with 'pinned' posts.
- Add a post field that highlights them gold and places them at the top of the homepage.
