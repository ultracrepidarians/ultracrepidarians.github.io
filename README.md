# Important commands

- Run locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
- Add: `git add --all`
- Commit: `git commit -m "message"`
- Push: `git push -u origin main`
- Force (if needed): `git push -u origin main --force`

# TODO

- Implement widgets: dark theme, socials, AOB.
- Look into minima for markdown support. Implement for posts.
	- Markdown partially works. Bold and headers tested working. Code block tested not working.
- Experiment with removing search bar on posts or something.

# Ideas

- Add a post field that highlights them gold and places them at the top of the homepage.

# Other notes
- Writers will publish markdown file/article text through Github Issues.
